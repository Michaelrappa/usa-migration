Our project will look at immigration into the United States. We will look at the major countries that have come to the United States and use data visualization to analyze trends in relation to major world events and immigration laws. The project will look for patterns in the data and hope to come to conclusions with it. We will be using data found from credible sources and plugging them into Tablaeu to create the visualizations.

## Historical and Digital Background

Immigration to the United States has been a staple to our countries growth both culturally and economically since the nations birth. Historically, there has been multiple causes for immigration as Quinn states. He states that immigrants look to escape conflict, healthcare, escape poverty "The American Dream", provide opprotunities toward children, and jobs. The past decade has put immigration up in political strife where the nation is divided on the current situation. Currently as it stands, Mexico is on top of the debate. There is a lot of push and pull for reasons on why Mexicans seek to immigrate here.  Aguila points out three categories for factors that cause immigration flows that can be used as a model for the rest of the countries in this project as well. These catagories are:

* _Demand-Pull_ - This is the job availability in the United States when the wages are a significant difference than Mexico's. 
* _Supply-Push_ - This is the cause of economic stability in Mexico's economy or others that drive people out of the country.
* _Networks_ - Friends and Family that spark migration from existing residents of the United States

With these categories this can be the base for looking at trends in data. Aguila also shows aruguments proving that even low employment rates in Mexico along with decreasing poverty rates still showed a relativily steady pace of migration. Finally, her arguments with networks also serve as a key to migration as her data shows the growth of established communities creating social ties to employments and aiding new migrations to the same occupation. These occupations grow in sync with the growing wage workers and assist in the United States GDP over time. The data and explantions by Aguila are patterns and trends that can be applied to other population growths such as in European populations in the north east and Asian populations in the west of the United States of America.

A large basis for this project was to look at how immigration laws affected the migrant flow over time for the United States. Liskofsky points out in their journal of the roots of immigration that is plagued with racism and "Nordic" superiority over other countries. Historically, The United States has shown resentment towards every newcomer as Liskofsky argues. From Catholic's and Jew's to eventually the Chinese where we first witness exclusionary acts in 1882. This leads into further restrictions seen by the Japanese as well before the second world war which is why our data shows such staggering delcines in immigration during the period. Following this period, Liskofsky dicussed multiple displaces and refugee acts that would bring immigration back to the states. Other important laws such as The immigration act of 1963 "Hart-Celler Act" abolished quotas and restrictions that helped skillful workers to come along with reuniting families. A basis that Aguila's catagories supports. As Kramer's article points out, this law ends post-war era fraught with anxiety about mass immigration, the shadow of European radicalism, and theories of racial superiority. This act would become the start of increased immigration from Central America and Asia. This law is what sparked the large increase in migration from Central America as Kramer points out. Kramer's article points out how Central America's population tripled from the 1960's to the end of the 90's. This massive increase in people and the new lower restrictions on migration have lead to Central America's percentage of immigration to take leaps and bounds in our data.
