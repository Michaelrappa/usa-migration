This source found on the MPI website was a number of databases available that became the backbone of the project. The data supplied us with immigration information from every country from the year 1820 to 2017. The organization is trasparent on the sources of their data which they gathered from the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of Immigration. It is important to note that the Department of Homeland Security is a relatively new department coming into fruition in 2002 under George W. Bush. This organization claims to be a nonpartisan organization with a mission focused on improving immigration policy. This was important as to avoid using biased data as much as possible but the data gathered is going to be biased regardless towards the mission of MPI. However, this set of data proved to be useful for the project to analyze trends in immigration. Because the data was created for humans to read, they had to be slightly modified for Tablaeu to read. The website already displayed visualizations on immigration but lumped all of the countries into one graph without catagorizing the countries.

This source was also an asset to the project as it gives us a clear picture of immigration with an animation. The animation shows the top five countries at any given point of time as well. This gives us a clear validation in our data and visuals used in the project. The author also gives an explanation about causes for certain groups of people immigrating during certain periods in linked articles on the page. This website is run by a professor at the University of Pennsylvania that teaches data visualization. This author credits the same data that we used in our project from the Migration Policy Institute as seen above as well as the Department of Homeland Security. The goal of the author just seems to be he uses these data visualizations for teaching so they are scholarly and do not seem to have an apparent particular perspective. So because of the credentials of the author, I do not see much if any negative bias in his data.
