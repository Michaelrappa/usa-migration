    * The role that I have in this project is a mixture of both Data Scientist and Visualization expert. I will do both because some of our sources give us the data we need that we do not even have to really scrape. I personally need to accomplish by executing the roles I have as perfect as possible to make this project look good. I intend to get there by using the sources that I have to make this project as presentable as not only but also my group would like. The tools I plan to really use more is tableau since that helps the most with my visualizations. If I need help with my roles to clear my confusions, I will ask my group members but mostly I plan on using the knowledge that I have acquired in class to help.
